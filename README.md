# my math
myMath is a projact that we get on class to solve math problems.
# Usage
you can use our [Java](https://java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml)
 project to solve math problems and calculate things like derivative,multiply,area and etc. Also you can see a graph of the function you create.
 
 we have three class in our project:
 # Monom
 The "Monom" department has the following functions: Different constructors, Monom calculation, derivative, addition of Monom to Monom, multiplication of Monoms, And so forth.
 
 # Polynom
 The "Polynom" functions include: Different constructors, addition of Polynom to Polynom, addition of Polynom to Polynom, subtraction of Polynom from Polynom, multiplication of Polynoms, comparison of Polynom, computation of area, derivative, integral calculation and roots of the functions.
  
# Complex functions
This class represents complex function that can be composed of Monom,Polynom, and ComplexFunction.
Every complex function has have left function, right function and operetion(plus,div,mult..)
